Mission Planner treatment of home location:

The number of WPs to be sent is set to the number of WPs in the WP list + one (namely #0, the home location)
Each WP is composed from list data and sent (with index + list index+1). The frame MAV_FRAME.GLOBAL is used if "absolute altitude" is checked, else MAV_FRAME_GLOBAL_RELATIVE_ALT.
The parameters(!) ALT_HOLD_RTL and RTL_ALT are set to the default alt. iff the "RTL@default alt" checkbox is checked.
The parameters(!) WP_RADUIS, LOITER_ALT and WP_LOITER_ALT are set.
