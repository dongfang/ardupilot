1) This is applied AFTER stibilize_stick_mixing_fbw:
static void stabilize_roll(float speed_scaler)
{
    if (crash_timer > 0) {
        nav_roll_cd = 0;
    }

That means, if crash_timer is nonzero, stick mixing gets killed.


2) nav_pitch_cd, nav_roll_cd: These are not really particularly nav related but more stabilization. Rename them?

3) attitude.pde, stabilize_stick_mixing_direct()
   Should PwM-domain values really be used outside RC_Channel? Was the purpose on RC_Channel t0
   conceal physical PWM stuff and translate it to abstract intervals for flight control?
