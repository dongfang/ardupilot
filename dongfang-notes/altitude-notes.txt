Altitudes and velocities in ArduPlane and ArduCopter MAVLink messages
=====================================================================
Soren Kuula

GLOBAL_POSITION_INT:
	alt = g_gps->altitude (to mm)
	relative_alt = relative_altitude() to mm (= current_loc.alt - home.alt)
	vx, vy, vz = velocity vector components from g_gps

Problem: ArduPlane and ArduCopter fly and navigate by current_loc.alt. This is an MSL altitude like g_gps->altitude but it may be derived from GPS and baro info together (smoother) and may not be equal to g_gps->altitude (GPS altitude inaccuracy).
alt and relative_alt are thus not directly comparable, and the difference between the two (which should be the home altitude) may vary over time (within bounds given by GPS accuracy).
Since the raw GPS altitude g_gps->altitude is a) noisy and not so useful and b) available for diagnostics etc. in the GPS_RAW message, I suggest using current_location.alt instead of g_gps->altitude in the GLOBAL_POSITION_INT message.

GPS_RAW:
	g_gps->altitude (to mm) 
	g_gps->ground_speed (to cm/s)
	g_gps->ground_course (to centidegrees)

VFR_HUD:
	airspeed = 
		Plane: Pure airspeed if enabled or else an estimate. If estimation fails, 0.
	       	Copter: GPS groundspeed.
	alt = current_loc.alt / 100 (in meters float)
	climb = climb rate is barometric
	groundspeed = g_gps->ground_speed (in m/s float)




NAV_CONTROLLER is useful, contains xtrack error, wp distance, nav and target bearing etc.

RAW_IMU2 has pressure and pressure minus init-pressure. Also has temperature.

RAW_IMU3 has "raw" pressure and "raw" temperature (unscaled sensor readings).
